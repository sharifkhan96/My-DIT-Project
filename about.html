<p>Danish Blood Donating Association is a Non-Governmental Organization which afford and donate blood for those who need it free of charge. We are active only in Afghaistan. And within Afghanistan we have several branches i.e. Kabul, Jalalabad, Herat and Mazer-I-Sharif and we are willing to extend our branches due to the demand of the customers. We in our offices meet with two kinds of people: First those who wish to donate their precious blood and second those who need the blood for either theirselves or their friends and relatives. We provide food, juice and fruits for those who donated their blood and we also take care of those who need blood for appropriate time. Our services are appreciated and are being appreciated by many people. We are registered with the Ministry of Public Health. If someone wants to donate his/her blood we test his/her blood's group and registered him/her in our database. When someone else who need blood comes to us we asked his/her blood's group and call the equivalent donater to come for giving his/her blood.<br> We set up and established DBDA in 2020 and We are willing not to shut it down due to the demand of blood supply for the poor and needy ones.</p>
