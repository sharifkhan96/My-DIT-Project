<p class="paragraph">This is the official website of DBDA(Danish Blood Donating Association). We are active just in Afghanistan's several provinces like Kabul, Nangarhar, Balkh and Herat. We provide blood for every kind of human including military personnel or non-military persons free of charge. We are registered with the Ministry of Public Health of Afghanistan. We meet with two kinds of clients: First those who donate their blood for saving lives and secondly are those who need it the most. We register the blood donater's information in our database and when someone comes to us for obtaining the blood we contact the blood donater to come for giving his/her blood in order to save at least a life by the help of God. We are appreciated and are being appreciated by the community for setting up and establishing this association. We are willing to extend our branches across Afghanistan and not to shut it down because of the need for blood.</p>
